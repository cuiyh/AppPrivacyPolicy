This Service may contain links to third-party websites. These sites are not operated by me, and I assume no responsibility for their content, privacy policies, or practices. Review their policies before interacting with them.

If I discover such information has been provided, it will be promptly deleted. Parents/guardians aware of their child’s unauthorized data sharing should contact me for corrective action.
